## Table name
The table name needed can be set as an env variable named **TABLE_NAME** which is then used in our `save_to_cma_db` table.

**Note:** Ensure that you update the name when you set up the database.sql file as well. 

## Analytics
[Fathom analytics](https://usefathom.com/) are used to provide visitor data. These are included on each page when a **FATHOM_ID** is set as an env variable.
